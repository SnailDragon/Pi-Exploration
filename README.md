# Pi-Exploration
Learning to use GPIO and other things on the raspberry pi

### Blink 
&emsp;Basic blink program, toggles on and off an LED.

### Matrix LED
&emsp;Work in progress - will hopefully control a 8x32 LED matrix without using a library

### MultiColorLED
&emsp;Takes terminal input to determine which pins on a multicolor LED are powered (y for on, anything else for off).

### One Seven Segment
&emsp;Takes terminal input in the form of "binary" string (1 is on, anything else is off) and uses it to turn on/off segments of a single seven segment display digit. 

### Piezo Buzzer
&emsp;Beeps a piezo buzzer.

### Safe Storage Scheme
&emsp;A template for a data collection sketch that writes every specified number of cycles to avoid data loss due to power loss.

### Tilt Switch
&emsp;Turns on/off an LED based on if a tilt switch is connected or not.
